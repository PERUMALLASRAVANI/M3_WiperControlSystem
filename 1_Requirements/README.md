# INTRODUCTION

Wipers are mounted on all heavy motor vehicles, including cars, trucks, railroad locomotives, and some aircraft.
After reading various research articles, I realised that safety standards for motor vehicles in inclement weather are important even at low speeds, 
therefore I began developing a wiper control system employing arm-based microcontrollers.
Rubber blades are affixed to the metal arms, while pivot magnets are attached to the other ends.
Finally, this project application assists users in their daily lives by preventing accidents and allowing for safe and healthy travel.

# DESCRIPTION 

In cars, a wiper control system replaces the standard wiper blade with an electrical component. In this setup, the ignition button (on the motor) will be 
controlled by a single switch in the ACC position. Switch on the wiper system with a second press, then vary the wiper speed with a third press, and finally
turn off the motor with a fourth press. All of this was done with the help of LEDs and a simulation tool.

# FEATURES

For a specified frequency, blue, green, and orange LEDs turn on and off alternately. The RED led will be on in state A. Circuit design is simple and straightforward. 
The car will be locked when the button is pressed ONCE.
The car will open when the button is pressed TWICE.
It will turn on and move clockwise after being pressed three times.
It will wiper off and move in an anticlockwise direction after being pressed FOUR times.
The wiper will finish one cycle if the button is pressed FIVE times.
