# ABSTRACT

A wiper is an important part of a vehicle's windscreen that removes rain or any other liquid. Manual wiper activation was required in the old approach,
and elevating the wiper was difficult. As a result, this approach is being promoted as a potential solution to these issues. 
The project's objectives are to provide wiping systems for older cars, improve the system by employing actuators and pull switches
(using the same switch for many purposes by stepwise switching), and manage engine and wiper speed with a single switch. In reaction to the amount of rain, 
this system controls the wiper's working speed. The major function of the Wiper Speed Control System is to remove rain air drops from the windshield of all types
of vehicles.
